# `DecentraVerify`

## *Project Overview*
DecentraVerify is a web3 dApp that leverages the Internet Computer (ICP) to provide secure, decentralized credential storage and veriification. It eliminates credential fraud by ensuring tamper-proof, on-chain validation.

Built for Universities, Employers & Institutions - Instaantly verify degrees,certfications, and professional credentials.

Secure & Permissionless - No reliance on centralized databases, reducing risk of fraud and data breaches.

ICP-Powered - Utilizes Motoko-based smart contracts for seamless blockchain integration.

A decentralized app for storing and verifying credentials on the ICP blockchain.

Welcome to your new `DecentraVerify` project and to the Internet Computer development community. By default, creating a new project adds this README and some template files to your project directory. You can edit these template files to customize your project and to include your own code to speed up the development cycle.

To get started, you might want to explore the project directory structure and the default configuration file. Working with this project in your development environment will not affect any production deployment or identity tokens.

To learn more before you start working with `DecentraVerify`, see the following documentation available online:

- [Quick Start](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/setup/deploy-locally)
- [SDK Developer Tools](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/setup/install)
- [Motoko Programming Language Guide](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/motoko/main/motoko)
- [Motoko Language Quick Reference](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/motoko/main/language-manual)

If you want to start working on your project right away, you might want to try the following commands:

```bash
cd decentra_verify_m/
dfx help
dfx canister --help
```

## Running the project locally

If you want to test DecentraVerify locally and explore how on-chain credential verification works, use the following commands:

```bash
# Starts the replica, running in the background
dfx start --background

# Deploys your canisters to the replica and generates your candid interface
dfx deploy
```

Once the job completes, your application will be available at `http://localhost:4943?canisterId={asset_canister_id}`.

If you have made changes to your backend canister, you can generate a new candid interface with

```bash
npm run generate
```

at any time. This is recommended before starting the frontend development server, and will be run automatically any time you run `dfx deploy`.

If you are making frontend changes, you can start a development server with

```bash
npm start
```

Which will start a server at `http://localhost:8080`, proxying API requests to the replica at port 4943.

## *Future Enhancements*
Multi-Blockchain Integration - Expansion to Ethereum, Solana, & Polkadot for wider adoption.

Decentralized Organization Management - Institutions can issue & revoke credentials using smart contracts.

Mobile-Friendly Interface - Optimized for mobile users & digital credential sharing.

### Note on frontend environment variables

If you are hosting frontend code somewhere without using DFX, you may need to make one of the following adjustments to ensure your project does not fetch the root key in production:

- set`DFX_NETWORK` to `ic` if you are using Webpack
- use your own preferred method to replace `process.env.DFX_NETWORK` in the autogenerated declarations
  - Setting `canisters -> {asset_canister_id} -> declarations -> env_override to a string` in `dfx.json` will replace `process.env.DFX_NETWORK` with the string in the autogenerated declarations
- Write your own `createActor` constructor
